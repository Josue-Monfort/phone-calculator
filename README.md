# Project Side Notes
## Responsive Design
My knowledge about responsive design is very poor. So to make this project responsive was a bit of a challenge, especially to make the buttons stay inside the phone container when the screen stretches. I'm not totally satisfied with the end result, but I'm happy to finish something that I was struggling with.

## JavaScript
This project really put my JavaScript abilities in check. It was very challenging but also a fun project to make. I learned a lot about functions and how to use parameters . Also, got some practice using the switch statement. I got a better undestanding of how JavaScript works.

## Logic
Some features were tough to implement. Change the current math operation when a user selects another operation, make the equals function, prevent the user to input more than one zero if there is no number on the display and other things. They were very challenging to do, but I was able to finish this project by using the "break the problem into small problems" approach.

# Overall Thoughts
Doing this project made me a better developer for sure. I had to learn a lot of things to finish it, I went to the documentation to check about forEach paramenters, event listeners events, see how to use a switch stament properly and many other things, but also searched a lot to find answers to my questions. Without the help from those people answering those questions I would probably not make it, so thank you all for the help!
